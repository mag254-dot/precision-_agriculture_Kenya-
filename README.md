##project purpose
The **Precision Agriculture Kenya** project aims to enhance food security for rural farmers in Kenya by implementing sustainable agricultural practices. By leveraging modern techniques and technologies, we seek to improve crop yields, soil health, and pest management.

## Objectives
- **Increase Crop Yield**: Implement soil health monitoring to guide fertilization and improve overall productivity.
- **Pest and Disease Management**: Introduce effective pest control practices to reduce crop losses.
- **Irrigation Training**: Provide training on efficient irrigation methods suitable for water-scarce areas.

## Intended Impact
This project is designed to empower rural farmers with the knowledge and tools necessary to adapt to changing agricultural conditions. By improving farming practices, we aim to:
- Enhance food security in local communities.
- Increase farmers' incomes through better yields.
- Promote sustainable agricultural practices that protect the environment.
